## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze temperature trends to determine whether it would be a sustainable year-round business. In order to assist W. Avy, temperature statistics for June and December were analyzed in Oahu to drive the decision.
### Data
Data presented includes temperature statistics for June and December 2010-2017.

## Results and Analysis
### Results
Through our data set and the analysis of temperature data, we determined the following:
 1. The mean temperature for June is 74.9 F, while the mean temperature for December is 71.0 F.
 2. The median temperature for June is 75.0 F, while the median temperature for December is 71.0 F.
 3. There are fewer data points for December (1,517) versus June (1,700).

### Analysis
Given the dispersion of data between June and December, we would need further information in order to make an informed decision on temperature analysis between 2010-2017.

## Summary
### Results
While the above dataframes provide helpful information on temperature in Oahu, we would need to fully understand the trends, inclusive of the same information between both months for the 2010-2017 timeframe. Temperatures in Oahu do not vary much between June and December.

### Additional Queries
Overall, the use of this data can be very helpful for future temperature analysis. I would recommend the following:
1. Review statistics for March temperatures in Oahu.
2. Review statistics for September temperatures in Oahu.

By reviewing temperatures in various points of the year, this will help W. Avy get a broader picture of weather in Oahu. With this extra information, W. Avy should be able to assess the spring and fall months adequately to make an informed decision of whether their business is sustainable year-round.
